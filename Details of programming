## 🌐 Simple Blockchain Implementation

This section covers the basic implementation of a blockchain using Python. It includes the following components:

- 🧱 `Block` class: Represents a single block in the blockchain, containing properties such as index, proof number, previous hash, data, timestamp, and a method to calculate the block's hash.
- ⛓️ `Blockchain` class: Manages the blockchain, including methods for creating the genesis block, performing proof of work, verifying the proof, adding new blocks, adding transactions, and checking the integrity of the blockchain.

```python
class Block:
    # ... implementation ...

class Blockchain:
    # ... implementation ...
```

Usage example:

```python
new_blockchain = Blockchain()
new_blockchain.add_new_transaction("First Transaction")
new_blockchain.add_new_transaction("Second Transaction")
new_block = new_blockchain.add_block(new_blockchain.curr_data)
print(new_block)
```

## 💰 Blockchain Transactions

This section introduces blockchain transactions and their integration into the blockchain. It includes the following components:

- 💸 `Transaction` class: Represents a single transaction with a sender, recipient, amount, and timestamp.
- 🧱 `Block` class: Modified to include a list of transactions and the Merkle root.
- ⛓️ `Blockchain` class: Updated to handle transactions, including methods for adding transactions and mining blocks with pending transactions.

```python
class Transaction:
    # ... implementation ...

class Block:
    # ... implementation ...

class Blockchain:
    # ... implementation ...
```

Usage example:

```python
blockchain = Blockchain()

transaction1 = Transaction('Alice', 'Bob', 10)
blockchain.add_transaction(transaction1)

block = blockchain.mine_pending_transactions()
print(block.to_dict())
```

## ⚙️ Smart Contracts

This section introduces smart contracts and their execution on the blockchain. It includes the following components:

- 💻 `SmartContract` class: Represents a smart contract with its code and an `execute` method to execute the contract with a given transaction.
- 🧱 `Block` class: Modified to include a list of smart contracts and their code in the block hash calculation.
- ⛓️ `Blockchain` class: Updated to handle smart contracts, including methods for adding and executing smart contracts during block mining.

```python
class SmartContract:
    # ... implementation ...

class Block:
    # ... implementation ...

class Blockchain:
    # ... implementation ...
```

Usage example:

```python
blockchain = Blockchain()

contract_code = "def execute(transaction): return transaction.amount <= 10"
contract = SmartContract(contract_code)
blockchain.add_smart_contract(contract)

transaction1 = Transaction('Alice', 'Bob', 5)
blockchain.add_transaction(transaction1)

block = blockchain.mine_pending_transactions()
print(block.to_dict())
```

## ⛏️ Proof of Work (PoW)

This section implements the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm for mining blocks in a blockchain network. It includes the following components:

- 🧱 `Block` class: Modified to include a difficulty level and a nonce, along with methods for performing proof of work and calculating the block hash.
- ⛓️ `Blockchain` class: Updated to handle the difficulty level and validate blocks based on the PoW criteria.

```python
class Block:
    # ... implementation ...

class Blockchain:
    # ... implementation ...
```

Usage example:

```python
difficulty = 4  # Adjust the difficulty level as desired

blockchain = Blockchain(difficulty)

transactions1 = ["Alice sends 1 BTC to Bob", "Bob sends 2 BTC to Charlie"]
block1 = blockchain.add_block(transactions1)
print(f"Block {block1.index} created with hash: {block1.hash}")
```

## 🥩 Proof of Stake (PoS)

This section implements the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm as an alternative to PoW. It includes the following components:

- 🧱 `Block` class: Modified to include a validator instead of a nonce.
- ⛓️ `Blockchain` class: Updated to handle validators and choose a validator for creating a new block.

```python
class Block:
    # ... implementation ...

class Blockchain:
    # ... implementation ...
```

Usage example:

```python
validators = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]

blockchain = Blockchain(validators)

transactions1 = ["Alice sends 5 coins to Bob", "Charlie sends 2 coins to David"]
validator = blockchain.choose_validator()
block1 = blockchain.add_block(transactions1, validator)
print(f"Block {block1.index} created by {validator} with hash: {block1.hash}")
```

## ⛓️ Mining and Block Discovery

This section simulates the mining process and the block discovery protocol in a decentralized network. It includes the following components:

- 🧱 `Block` class: Modified to include difficulty and perform proof of work.
- 🔮 `Node` class: Represents a node in the P2P network, with methods for mining blocks, broadcasting blocks, and receiving blocks.
- ⛓️ `Blockchain` class: Manages the blockchain and handles block addition and validation.

```python
class Block:
    # ... implementation ...

class Node:
    # ... implementation ...

class Blockchain:
    # ... implementation ...
```

Usage example:

```python
node1 = Node(1, 4)
node2 = Node(2, 4)
node3 = Node(3, 4)

node1.add_peer(node2)
node1.add_peer(node3)
node2.
